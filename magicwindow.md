❉ Hello ❉

`magicwindow` is a "self aware puzzle game" from [BootMe_-_CrackMe](https://xlogicx.net/BootMe_-_CrackMe.html). These puzzles are boot loaders, and can be ran with `qemu-system-i386`.

Once loaded, `d` shows the hex dump of the program. `Enter` clears the display, and allows you to enter two hex values with `i` and `Enter`.
